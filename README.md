# Summer Internship Program on Analog IC Design  
*A Student‚Äôs Journey & Resource Hub*

***

## üëã Welcome!

Hello and welcome!  
If you‚Äôre curious about what it‚Äôs like to dive into analog IC design‚Äîor just looking for some solid, hands-on resources‚Äîyou‚Äôve landed in the right place. I‚Äôm a B.Tech student who recently completed the **Summer Internship Program on Analog Integrated Circuit (IC) Design**, and this repo is both my portfolio and a guide for anyone following in my footsteps.

***

## üå± Why I Signed Up

I wanted something more than just lectures and theory‚ÄîI was itching to actually design real circuits, learn industry tools that professionals use, and discover how an abstract MOSFET drawing becomes a working microchip. A USB-MIDI microphone front-end as a project? Count me in!

***

## üöÄ What I Learned (and What You Can Too!)

### Things That Just ‚ÄúClicked‚Äù

- **CMOS Device Physics:** Not just a chapter‚Äîit's the magic behind every transistor!
- **Designing Key Building Blocks:** Built current mirrors, differential amps, and cascodes by hand.
- **EDA Tools (Open-Source!):**  
  - **ngspice:** for circuit simulations.
  - **xschem:** for making my schematics ‚Äúcome alive.‚Äù
  - **magic:** making layouts that actually get fabricated.
  - **KICAD:** won me over for PCB design.
  - **Python (numpy, scipy, matplotlib):** because real engineers aren‚Äôt afraid of data.

- **‚ÄúBig Picture‚Äù System Design:** Got to see all these blocks power a real-world application‚ÄîUSB-MIDI mic front-end‚Äîfor the first time.

***

## üìÖ How the Program Rolled Out

- **Duration:** 3 weeks, ~100 hours (it flies by!)
- **Setup:** Split between morning theory, afternoon labs, and a final project sprint.
- **Batch:** Just 25 of us‚Äîplenty of peer learning and one-on-one help.

### Week-at-a-Glance

| Week | We Explored... |
|------|----------------|
| 1    | Linear circuits, resistors/caps/coils, intro to MOSFETs, running basic simulations |
| 2    | MOS physics deep-dive, advanced simulation, building analog ‚Äúlego blocks‚Äù |
| 3    | Full-chip design in Skywater 130nm, layout in magic, PCB builds, testing‚Äîplus demo day! |

***

## üéØ My Personal Project

My main focus? Designing the full analog front-end for a **USB-MIDI microphone**. The journey:

- Drawing schematics in xschem (it was intimidating at first!).
- Running endless simulations in ngspice (coffee required).
- Laying out everything in magic, pixel by pixel.
- Prepping for real-world fabrication thanks to the TinyTapeout platform.

If you want to peek at all the files‚Äîsimulations, code, even my final report‚Äîit‚Äôs all in `/projects`.

***

## üóÇÔ∏è Your Guide to the Repo

- `/materials` ‚Äì All my lecture notes, slides, and handpicked references.
- `/labs` ‚Äì Lab handouts, simulation files, and my own handwritten solution attempts.
- `/projects` ‚Äì My mic front-end project and some great examples from friends.
- `/setup` ‚Äì Straightforward steps to install and configure all those open-source EDA tools.

***

## ‚ú® What Made This Special

- **Everything was hands-on:** We didn‚Äôt just read; we designed, we built, we tested.
- **True open-source:** You can do all of this at home‚Äîno licenses, just learning.
- **Inspiring mentors:** Experts from Synopsys and professors who actually cared.
- **Peer power:** I learned as much from my batchmates as my instructors.

***

## üìù Some Advice from Someone Who‚Äôs Been There

- **Ask questions‚Äîalways.** The only dumb question is the one you don‚Äôt ask.
- **Simulate everything.** Try breaking stuff! You‚Äôll learn more fixing it.
- **Document your process.** Seriously‚Äîfuture-you will thank you.
- **Take creative detours.** Once you finish a lab, tweak the circuit and see what happens.

## üëè Thank Yous

Deep gratitude to **Dr. Saroj Rout**, **Prasant Swain**, and **Mrinal Das**‚Äînot just for the technical guidance, but for all the encouragement. You made the program what it was!
