# 02: Single Stage Amplifiers

## 2.1 Amplifier Types
- Common Source (MOS) / Common Emitter (BJT)
- Source Follower (MOS) / Emitter Follower (BJT)
- Cascode Amplifier

## 2.2 Key Parameters
- Gain (Av) = gm·ro
- Input Resistance: High for MOS, Medium for BJT
- Output Resistance: Depends on topology
- Bandwidth: Dominated by pole frequencies

## 2.3 Design Trade-Offs
- Higher gain → lower bandwidth
- High output swing vs linearity
- Power efficiency vs speed
